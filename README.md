# NMR-for-SpinQ
My python program to analyze data from SpinQ. This is the code I used to create my results. 
All the data I took is saved in the folder data. 
The images generated are saved under Images.
The processed data is saved under results. 
main for now just graphs the data.
The jupyther notebook named NMR is where I processed all my data. 
  I will be adding more details on functionality eventually.
